# Project2-Games-Per-Platform
Project Description
This project is dedicated to the development of an application for the analysis and recommendation of computer games. The project involves gathering data about various video games, including their ratings, genres, and platforms, as well as creating a model for predicting the success of a game based on various parameters.

Project Goal
The aim of this study is to assist the gaming industry in understanding the factors that influence the success of a video game and provide recommendations for the development of new games and the management of current projects.

Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used for this project:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
Project Steps
Step 1: Data Collection
Loading data about computer games.
Initial analysis of the data structure.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values.
Handling duplicates.
Changing data types.
Creating new features as needed.
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzing the distribution of games by genre.
Investigating the relationship between critic and user ratings and game success.
Analyzing the impact of gaming platforms on game sales.
Step 4: Model Building
Creating a model to predict game success based on selected parameters.
Evaluating the model's quality and selecting the optimal one.
Step 5: Conclusions
Summarizing conclusions about the factors that influence the success of computer games.
Providing recommendations for game developers and publishers.
Findings
The genre of a game significantly affects its success, with some genres being more popular and profitable than others.
Critic and user ratings have an impact on game sales, but they do not always determine success.
Gaming platforms have their own lifecycle, and it's essential to consider their relevance when planning game releases.
Possible Reasons for Data Gaps
Data gaps may arise due to insufficient information about certain games, data collection errors, or missing data in specific sources.

Why Filling Missing Values with Medians Is the Best Solution for Scale Variables
Selecting the median to fill missing values is the best solution for scale variables because the median is robust to outliers and is not skewed by extreme values, making it the preferred method for mitigating the impact of outliers on the overall dataset.

General Conclusion
Analyzing data on computer games has revealed crucial factors influencing game success. These findings can be utilized by game developers and publishers to make more informed decisions and optimize strategies in the video game industry.
